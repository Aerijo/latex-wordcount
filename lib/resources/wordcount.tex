% If you run LaTeX on wordcount.tex it will prompt you for the name of a
% document to be counted. For most people, however, it will be more
% convenient to run the shell script wordcount.sh, giving the document
% name as the first argument. The comments in wordcount.sh
% give further information about the usage and limitations of this tool.

% The fundamental idea is to mark each character and interword space
% with a unique tag that will show up in TeX "showbox" output. Then
% arrange to make the output routine trigger a TeX overfull vbox message
% for the page box so that everything gets reported in the TeX log.
% Then run grep -c (or an equivalent text search utility, e.g., perl) on
% the log file to count the occurrences.
%
% In showbox output, a character is typically represented by a line of
% the form
%
%   ...\T1/cmr/m/n/10 e
%
% where "\T1/cmr/m/n/10" is the font name. We arrange things so that all
% characters are typeset in a font named "\3.08632". Furthermore, for
% interword spaces, which are normally represented in the output as
% something like
%
%   ...\glue 3.33333 plus 1.66666 minus 1.11111
%
% we use \spaceskip to ensure that it always appears as
%
%   ...\glue(\spaceskip) 3.08633 plus 9.0
%
% Then to count characters (including word spaces) we can
% grep for lines matching "3.0863", while to count words we
% count the number of lines in the log that match "3.08633" but not
% "3.08632".
%
% For an accurate count in multi-line paragraphs we also need
% to set rightskip to the flag value, since interword spaces are
% discarded at line breaks; and on the presumption that hyphenated
% compounds like "steady-state" should be counted as two words, we set
% \exhyphenpenalty to a value that ensures a line break at *every*
% explicit hyphen---then we will get a rightskip glue node between the
% two parts. (How about em-dashes? you may ask. Answer: it works all
% right, try it and see.)

The 'wordcount' utility provides a way of estimating the number of
words in a LaTeX document.

[Warning: The counting method uses a large log file as an intermediate
step. If your disk space is extremely low the counting process
may end prematurely for lack of space.]
